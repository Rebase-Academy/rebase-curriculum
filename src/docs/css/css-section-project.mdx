Hi there again! Congratulations on finishing this second section of the course. Right now, you already know the basics (and some) of HTML and CSS, two powerful technologies that lets you build beautiful sites. Still, there's so much more you can learn (and you will in the next sections), but for now, there's so many things you can start building already. For that, we've linked another project from freeCodeCamp. This one also includes HTML (Unfortunately, there's not so much you can do with CSS without HTML as you'll know by now) but you should feel comfortable enough with it to start focusing on **how** you want your website to look like.

Here you'll need to build a personal portfolio. The exercises give you an example on how it should look, but feel free to include your own designs and look for inspiration on the internet (feel free to ask your teachers if you want some examples). Try to take this exercise seriously enough to keep posting your future achievements, so you can use them when looking for a job. They can prove really useful in those circumstances!

As always, if you feel like you're stuck, we're here to help you! Good luck!
