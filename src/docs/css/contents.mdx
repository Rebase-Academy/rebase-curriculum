## 01. Introduction to CSS

### Basic CSS styling

This is how CSS looks like:

```css
h1 {
  color: blue;
  background-color: yellow;
  border: 1px solid black;
}

p {
  color: red;
}
```

Let's read it:

1. First, we have two selectors (`h1` and `p`). Each one will affect all `h1` and `p` tags in our page.
2. The first one will look for all `h1` tags and will apply the properties between the brackets to those tags.
    1. The first one sets the text color to blue.
    2. The second sets the background color to yellow.
    3. The third one puts a border around the header that is 1 pixel wide, solid (not dotted, or dashed, etc.), and colored black.
3. The second selector (`p`) will change the text to red.

### **CSS Selector**

One of the core things about CSS is to address the element that you want to style. If you fail to do so, you could be altering many other elements that you didn't want to style that way or not style anything at all due to lack of selector accuracy.

Every selector of CSS is composed of a selector and its attributes. There are multiple selector types and hundreds of attributes, but most of the time it will follow the same structure.

This is how a CSS selector looks like:

![.CSS syntax explanation](./css-syntax.png)

**Important**: If a property is unknown or if a value is not valid for a given property, the declaration is deemed invalid and is wholly ignored by the browser's CSS engine.

You will read more about CSS selectors in the next section, this was just an introduction.

### **Adding a stylesheet**

There are three different ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come across, some more useful than others.

[Three Different Types of CSS Styles: The Complete Guide](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/difference-between-inline-external-and-internal-css)

[How to add CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp)

- Why would you choose one over another?
- What do you think is the cleanest way?

### **Comments**

Comments are parts of our CSS that will not affect the HTML. It is used to write messages for the programmer of the website. A comment looks like this:

```jsx
/* This is a CSS comment */
```

Content inside comments will not have any consequence on the styling.

## 02. CSS Selectors

In CSS, selectors are used to target the **HTML** **elements** we want to style on our web pages.

There is a wide variety of CSS selectors available, allowing for fine-grained precision when selecting elements to style.

Each selector can access the HTML items by different means; by id (#) by class (.), by HTML tag (`<>`) and there are even more specific selectors which you will read about in the next section.

[CSS selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors)

### Main Selectors

Main selectors include IDs, classes, attributes or HTML tags.

[CSS Selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_selectors.asp)

### Other selectors

However, there's plenty of other selectors which will help you attack the element or elements that you want to style in particular circumstances. Some of these are called pseudo-class or pseudo selectors.

[CSS Selectors Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp)

[CSS4-Selectors | All selectors from level 4 to 1](https://css4-selectors.com/selectors/)

### Combining selectors

Selectors can be used individually or collectively. They can be very powerful when combined.

[Combinators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors/Combinators)

[Multiple Class / ID and Class Selectors | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/multiple-class-id-selectors/)

[Speed Up by Grouping Multiple CSS Selectors](https://www.lifewire.com/grouping-multiple-css-selectors-3467065)

- Can you use several selectors at the same time?
- Why would you attempt to do this?
- Is there a possible way of selecting all `<p>` on a website except the last one?

**Extra!**

If you want to have a broader understanding of CSS and how it works, check this article out. However, this is not part of the mandatory materials of the course.

## 03. Box Model

Every HTML element is represented as a rectangular box, with the box's content, padding, border, and margin built up around one another like the layers of an onion. Before understanding how to create CSS layouts, you need to understand the box model.

### CSS Box model

![Box model](./box-model.png)

![Spacing](./spacing.png)

This representation of elements as boxes allows us to effectively distribute content within our webpage. There are different approaches to do so, but before we get to that part, make sure you understand how this works:

[Introduction to the CSS basic box model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Introduction_to_the_CSS_box_model)

See an example of how box model works here

[CSS Box Model](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp)

### CSS Units

Some CSS attributes require a unit value. Some that you might come across already is the pixel value (px) or the percentage (%). There are many, we will review the most important.

Just like we measure meters in a room to find furniture that fits in it, we need to measure the elements on our webpage. CSS Units allow us to measure and compare different items.

Read about absolute and relative numeric values and percentages:

[CSS values and units](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units)

### Box model example

As we saw at the beginning of this chapter, the **actual** width and height of a box will be

> Width = Content-box + padding + border + margin

So if we do this:

```
.box {
  width: 200px;
  border: 1px solid green;
  padding: 1rem;
  margin: 2rem;
}
```

The actual *rendered* (as seen on screen) width would be

> width = 200px + 1rem + 1px + 2rem

Hard to calculate, isn't it?

### Box sizing

To avoid the confusion we've seen before, most developers change the default browser behavior.

**box-sizing** **is a CSS property that sets how the total width and height of an element is calculated.** When we set the value of box-sizing to border-box the final calculation will differ. The width and height properties will include the content, padding, and border, but do not include the margin.

This part can be easy to implement but hard to understand, so read the article below to make sure you acquire the knowledge before executing it.

## 04. Cascade and inheritance

Cascade and inheritance are very important in order to determine which selector will have more power over the rest.

Sometimes, different styles are applied to the same element. In order to decide which style should prevail, cascade and inheritance will have their say. Read these articles to understand this conflicting rules.

## 05. CSS Layout

CSS page layout techniques allow us to take elements contained in a web page and control where they are positioned relative to their default position in normal layout flow.

As aforementioned, distributing content in our webpage flow can be dealt by several means. Have a look at the main options.

### Default layout flow: inline vs block

Normal flow is how the browser lays out HTML pages by default when you do nothing to control page layout.

[display](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display)

[Inline vs Inline-block vs Block](https://dev.to/shimphillip/inline-vs-inline-block-vs-block-280h)

### Positioning

Positioning allows you to take elements out of the normal document layout flow, and make them behave differently; for example sitting on top of one another, or always remaining in the same place inside the browser viewport.

[position](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position)

### Flexbox

The main goal of flexbox is to craft one-dimensional layout structures (vertical or horizontal). Items in flex layouts will shrink or grow to fill the space available and will position relative to the parent container.

[Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox)

## 06. Responsive

It is fairly common to create a Website or app that changes its user interface depending on the browser or device accessing the site to provide an optimized experience.

Developers usually create a single version of the website which doesn't care about what browser or platform is accessing the site, but instead uses feature tests to find out what code features the browser supports or what the values of certain browser features are, and then adjusts the code appropriately.

### Basics

Please read these articles to know the basic concepts of responsive designs.

[Responsive design](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design)

[The building blocks of responsive design](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Responsive/responsive_design_building_blocks)

### Using **Developer Tools Responsive Design Mode**

Responsive Design Mode is a tool from your browser developer tools that gives you a simple way to simulate a range of layouts of different devices — particularly mobile phones and tablets as well as desktops and laptops.

Read this article to understand how it works

[Responsive Design Mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Responsive_Design_Mode)

### Media queries

Media queries lets you adapt your site or app depending on the presence or value of various device characteristics and parameters.

See an example of its syntax:

```css
.box {
    width: 75%;
}

@media all and (max-width: 1024px) {
  .box {
      width: 50%;
  }
}
```

- What platforms do you use to access the internet?
- Do you know phone applications which also have a webpage? Are they the same or different? Do they look the same? Do they have similar functionalities?

## 07. Custom Properties

**Custom properties** (sometimes referred to as CSS variables) are variables defined by CSS authors that contain specific values to be reused throughout a document (similar to JS variables). They are set using custom property notation (e.g., `--main-color: black;`) and are accessed using the var() function (e.g., `color: var(--main-color);`).

Complex websites have very large amounts of CSS, often with a lot of repeated values. For example, the same color might be used in hundreds of different places, requiring global search and replace if that color needs to change. Custom properties allow a value to be stored in one place, then referenced in multiple other places.

[Using CSS custom properties (variables)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties)

```css
.parent-element {
    --main-color: #000;
}

.child-element {
    background: var(--main-color);
}

/* Custom properties using fallback value */
.sibling-element[attr] {
    background: var(--main-color, #fff);
}

```
