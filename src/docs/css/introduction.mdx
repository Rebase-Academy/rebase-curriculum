CSS stands for `Cascading Style Sheets`.
With CSS, we give **styles** to our webpage. As you remember, with HTML we created the webpage structure. Now, with CSS we will focus on how the structure 'looks'. For instance, you could alter the font, color, size and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.
In this module, you will learn how to select elements in your webpage and how to effectively style them.

Imagine a **building** construction process:

- 🏗️  **HTML** would represent the foundation and skeleton of the building (the structure)
- 🏠 **CSS** will represent how it looks: is it made of glass? Is it painted in green? How big are the windows? Where will the door be? How will it be distributed?
- 💡 In the next chapter, **JavaScript** would be the mechanical and electrical installation (the interaction).

In order for you to have a broad, general sense of what CSS is, please read this article:
