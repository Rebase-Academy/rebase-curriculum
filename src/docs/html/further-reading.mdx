**HTML Tables**

💡 Tables are used in HTML documents to present tabular data. The reason why we haven't dedicated a whole chapter in this material to show you how to build them it's because they are becoming less and less used in favor of other technologies such as Flexbox and CSS Grid (don't worry about this, you'll learn what these are later on). However, we still think it's valuable and interesting that you know them, since, as in everything, there may be situations where you could still use them. If you're interested, read the following articles to learn about them:

**HTML emails**

💡 You want your emails to look good in every environment. Especially nowadays, when roughly half of all emails is opened on a mobile device, responsive design is essential to commercial email senders. In this article, we'll show you the basic principle of making a responsive HTML email using CSS Media Queries and provide you with an example. Even though we haven't taught you CSS yet, go and read the following article to know more about how emails are coded nowadays.
