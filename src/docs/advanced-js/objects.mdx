# Objects in depth

In the same way that functions abstract processes, objects abstract data. Objects can contain many values, and they are written asÂ `property: value`Â pairs.

Let's see again how to define a simple object:

```jsx
const p = {
    firstName: 'Ned',
    lastName: 'Stark',
    age: 40,
    isActive: false
};
```

> To access a property of an object we can use [p.name](http://p.name/) or p['firstName']. We can also loop over the properties with for (x in p) { ... }.

We already saw objects in the course. Now we are going to see some more advanced material related to them.

### The `this` keyword

Objects can contain any kind of values, and in particular they can contain functions. The functions defined inside an object are normally calledÂ *object methods*.

Let's try to create a method that returns the full name:

```jsx
const p = {
    firstName: 'Ned',
    lastName: 'Stark',
    fullName: function() { return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName; },
    age: 40,
    isActive: true
};
```

By usingÂ `this`Â we are able to make the function defined inside the object to refer to other properties of the object.

### Constructor

If we are going to create many objects with a similar structure, we can define an object type. For example, suppose you want to create an object type for cars. You want this type of object to be called Car, and you want it to have properties for make, model, and year. To do this, you would write the following function:

```jsx
function Car(make, model, year) {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
}
```

Notice the use ofÂ `this`Â to assign values to the object's properties based on the values passed to the function.

Now you can create an object called mycar as follows:

```jsx
var mycar = new Car('Eagle', 'Talon TSi', 1993);
```

This statement createsÂ `mycar`Â and assigns it the specified values for its properties. Then the value ofÂ `mycar.make`Â is the stringÂ `"Eagle"`,Â `mycar.year`Â is the integer 1993, and so on.

You can create any number of Car objects by calls to new. For example,

```jsx
var kenscar = new Car('Nissan', '300ZX', 1992);
var vpgscar = new Car('Mazda', 'Miata', 1990);
```

### Spread syntax

We can use the so-called spread syntax (`...`) for various purposes.

> You can find a detailed reference in [MDN-Spread syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax), but we will mention briefly the different uses here.

### Destructuring

For function calls:

```jsx
myFunction(...iterableObj);
```

For array literals or strings:

```jsx
[...iterableObj, '4', 'five', 6];
```

For object literals:

```jsx
let objClone = { ...obj };
```

> More details in [MDN-Destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment).

### Assignment

```jsx
[a, b] = [10, 20];

console.log(a);  // 10
console.log(b);  // 20

[a, b, ...rest] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

console.log(rest);  // [30, 40, 50]
```
