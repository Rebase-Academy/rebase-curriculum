## Introduction

An often overlooked feature in web development and specially in JavaScript frameworks are styles. CSS and its relation with HTML and JS is a very important part of our applications. It is very important to learn how to control how to link data and template to styles. 

## Goals

- [ ]  Bind data to HTML class attributes
- [ ]  How to style child components from parent components
- [ ]  Bind data to HTML styles attributes

## Basic tools

It might be awhile since you worked with CSS for the last time. Remember? If you don't, it could be a good time to review the difference between class and style attributes in HTML. Go back and check again the initial lessons CSS sections before going further in this section.

### Auto-prefixing

When you use a CSS property that requires a vendor prefix in :style, Vue will automatically add the appropriate prefix. Vue does this by checking which style properties are supported in the current browser. If the browser doesn't support a particular property, then various prefixed variants will be tested to try to find one that is supported.
