## Introduction

Often when we are developing user interfaces for the web we would like to customize the behavior of DOM events to provide a richer user experience. Form submissions, button clicks, and even scrolling all have associated DOM events that can be listened for and handled by our code. Whether we want to prevent or change the default behavior of these events, we need to listen to them and consume these events to achieve our desired behavior.

Vue provides the `v-on` directive which allows us to listen for and customize DOM events on our HTML elements by providing it with the name of the event. For example, `v-on:click` allows us to consume the click DOM event.

## Goals

- [ ]  Link to our previous JS knowledge
- [ ]  Learn how to listen to user interaction
- [ ]  Learn how to react to user interaction
- [ ]  Learn how to display and update data on user interaction

## Basic tools

In JavaScript we have already learned how event handling work. If you remember how to listen and react to user interaction, this part will be much easier since it is partially the same idea. Go back and check again the `Events and the DOM` lessons in basic JS section before going further in this section.
