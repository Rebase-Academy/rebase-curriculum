## Introduction

Components are one of the most powerful features of Vue.js. They help you extend basic HTML elements to encapsulate reusable code. Components can be reused as many times as you want or used in another component, making it a child component. As an example, if your component is a button, you can use it as many times as you want, and you won't need to write the button each time. Imagine a puzzle, using components is like creating pieces of your app like, menus, buttons, sidebars, etc. and the using this pieces to build a full app.


## Goals

- [ ]  Creating and reusing components
- [ ]  Organize an application with multiple components
- [ ]  Passing data between components

## Basic tools

Understanding the concept of component is not easy, but is a common feature in every JS framework out there, from the trendy ReactJS to the mature Ember. A component is a piece of code that wraps everything we have seen so far. From HTML structure to API connection, a component is just a small piece of everything you learned so far that, combined with other components, can develop a rich application. It sound scary at the beggining, but you will get used to it and will love it.

### Basic component

Before diving in components, you should know that all examples of Vue apps that we have seen so far have been examples of components. So, to be honest, you already know how a component is. 
  - üóíÔ∏è Read this section to review a basic component: https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/component-basics.html#base-example
  - üìΩÔ∏è Watch this laracast video about components: https://laracasts.com/series/learn-vue-2-step-by-step/episodes/7 

The great advantage of components is that you can reuse them as many times as you want and each time you will have a new instance of the component.
  - üóíÔ∏è Check this example on how to reuse a component: https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/component-basics.html#reusing-components

For example, you might have components for a header, sidebar, and content area, each typically containing other components for navigation links, blog posts, etc.

Play for a few minutes with this app, create, edit and delete some TODOS (https://todomvc.com/examples/vue/) 
  - Which components would you create?
  - Which components would you reuse?

### Communicating components

So far we learned how to reuse components, but that won't be very useful if every component has the same look and data. For components to be completely reusable they must be also configurable, receive and pass data.

### Passing data from parent to child components through events

- üìΩÔ∏è Watch this laracast exercise on how to create a reusable component and pass some data: https://laracasts.com/series/learn-vue-2-step-by-step/episodes/9

### Passing data from child to parent through events

To pass data from childs to parents we need to use a slightly more complicated system: events. Do you remember events?
In Vue, to pass data from child to parents we need to create a new event that parents will listen and use
