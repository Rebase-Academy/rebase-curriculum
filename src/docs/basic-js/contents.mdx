## 01. Introduction to JavaScript

### Computer programming

Computer programming is a way of giving computers instructions about what they should do next. These instructions are known as code, and computer programmers write code to solve problems or perform a task.

The end goal is to create something that could mean anything: from a web page, or a piece of software, or even just a pretty picture. That‚Äôs why computer programming is often described as a mix between art and science; it‚Äôs technical and analytical, yet creative at the same time.

Watch the following video about the concept of programming keeping in mind these questions: Can you explain what is programming? What is code? What is the end goal of coding?

### JavaScript language

üìñ  Read the article [JavaScript ‚Äî Dynamic client-side scripting](https://javascript.info/intro). Don't try to understand everything, just get the general idea of what JavaScript is and what we can achieve with it.

Can you explain the story behind this language? How do engines work? What can and can't JavaScript do in the browser? What are the 3 things that make JavaScript unique?

### Interpreted versus compiled code

üìñ  Read the article [Difference between Compiled and Interpreted Language](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-compiled-and-interpreted-language/). Now that you now the differences, JavaScript is it a compiled or interpreted programming language?

### Server-side versus client-side code

üìñ  Read  the article [Components: Server-Side vs. Client-Side](https://css-tricks.com/components-server-side-vs-client-side/) that will give you a wide picture on what it is Rendering, Interactivity, Performance, but at this point just try to explain the difference between client-side code and server-side code, and how is JavaScript involved.

## 02. Developer Tools

Every modern web browser includes a powerful suite of developer tools. These tools do a range of things, from inspecting currently-loaded HTML, CSS and JavaScript to showing which assets the page has requested and how long they take to load.

### The JavaScript console

üìñ  Read the tutorial [Get Started With Running JavaScript In The Console](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/javascript) provided by Chrome DevTools and get used to using your console and trying your code.

### Adding JavaScript to your page

Follow the instructions in this üñ•  [tutorial](https://medium.com/@tanya/add-javascript-to-a-web-page-46b192017c0e), which will help you create a JavaScript file, add it to your web page and test that it is working.

### Comments in JavaScript

Follow the instructions in this üñ•  [tutorial](https://www.bitdegree.org/learn/javascript-comment), and you'll learn how to write JavaScript comments and be able to leave notes in your JavaScript code.

### Exercises on FreeCodeCamp

Ok, now let's practice these new tools with these exercises at FreeCodeCamp.

## 03. JavaScript Tools

### Variables

JavaScript **variables** are containers for storing data values. The 3 containers that you need to keep in mind are: `var`, `const` & `let` ; and naming also plays an important role. This üìñ  article [What is a variable?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Variables#what_is_a_variable), will give you a wide understanding of these concepts, and you will also find an introducction to **Arrays []** that we will cover further in more detail**.**

### Conditionals

**Conditional statements** allow us to represent decision making in JavaScript, from the choice that must be made (e.g. "one cookie or two"), to the resulting outcome of those choices. The most common type of conditional statement is the `if...else` and the operators to keep in mind are:

`===` means equal

`!==` means not equal

`<` or `>` test if one value is less than or greater than another.

`<=` or `>=` test if one value is less than or or equal to, greater than or equal to.

`&&` means AND

`||` means OR

Ok, with this introduction let's get to it with this üìñ  article [You can have it on one condition..!](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/conditionals)

**Exercises on FreeCodeCamp**

Well done! now we will make a good use of all this learning and have fun achieving the following exercises at FreeCodeCamp.

### Arrays

**Arrays** are lists of values that can be stored in **variables** and dealt with in much the same way as any other type of value, the difference being that we can access each value inside the list individually, and do super useful and efficient things with the list, like loop through it and do the same thing to every value. Exciting, isn't it? Let's get a brighter picture with this üìñ  article [What is an array?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Arrays#what_is_an_array)

**Exercises on FreeCodeCamp**

üåü Until here, we have covered the most important tools in order to start writing your first functions and telling your computer what you want to achieve. ü§ò Let's keep rocking this learning path with some exercises from FreeCodeCamp.

- **Array Exercises**

### Functions

A **function** is a code snippet that can be called by other code or by itself, or a variable that refers to the function. In other words, function definition include the orders and function calls state when to execute those orders. In this üìñ   article [Where do I find functions?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Functions#where_do_i_find_functions), you'll explore fundamental concepts behind functions such as basic syntax, how to invoke and define them, scope, and parameters.

**Exercises on FreeCodeCamp**

So far we have learnt about variables, conditionals, arrays and functions. It seems we are ready to start writing our own functions with these exercises from FreeCodeCamp

- **Function Exercises**
1. [Write Reusable JavaScript with Functions](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/write-reusable-javascript-with-functions)

### Exercises for further practice

Next, you will find a series of exercises that summarize what you've learnt throughout this lesson and exercises at FreeCodeCamp. Try to do them on your own, we haven't introduced anything new and all of them just go through what you've seen until this section. Remember you can always ask any staff member on Slack. Give it a try!

- **Exercise 1 - The Lifetime Supply Calculator**

How many potatoes will a person eat until the end of his life? Discover yourself!

1. Store the persons current age into a variable.
2. Store an estimated maximum age into a variable.
3. Store an estimated amount per week (as a number).
4. Calculate how many weeks will happen until the end of this person life.
5. Calculate how many potatoes would eat total for the rest of his life.
6. Output the result to the screen by console like so: "NAME has NN years and will eat NN potatoes until age of X".

- **Exercise 2 - True or false**

Using prompt, variables and¬†**conditionals**, ask questions to the users and display the result on the console.

1. Ask: "Tomatoes are fruits, not vegetables: true or false". If that answer is "true" you show "correct", otherwise show "incorrect".
2. Ask: "You should drink 8 glasses of water: true or false". If that answer is "false" you show "correct", otherwise show "incorrect".
3. Ask: "Fishes have only three seconds of memory: true or false". If that answer is "false" you show "correct", otherwise show "incorrect".
4. Ask: "The Great Wall of China is the only man made structure visible from space The Great Wall of China: true or false". If that answer is "true" you show "correct", otherwise show "incorrect".

Have fun! Create more true or false questions.

**Bonus points**

1. Create a variable¬†`points`¬†and initialize it to zero.
2. If the answer is correct, add 10 points to the¬†`points`¬†variable.
3. If the answer is incorrect, remove 5 points to the¬†`points`¬†variable.
4. Display how many points the user has on the console.

- **Exercise 3 - A dinner**

Imagine you are a famous singer in a band and you want to invite other musicians to a dinner.

Write an array of every musician and its band in a format¬†`musician:band`¬†and using only one console log, display the list of assistants in the console.

## 04. Events and the DOM

### DOM API

DOM is the shortcut for: **The Document Object Model**. And what does this means? Well in short "is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web".

Ok, and what does this has to do with JavaScript? Let's read this üìñ  article [What is the DOM?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction#what_is_the_dom) to have a better understanding and how this two connect and what can be achieved.

### Events listeners

Now we will have a look at the DOM event Model. First have a look at this [diagram](https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#dom-event-architecture) that explains the three phases of event flow through the DOM in the DOM Level 3 Events draft.

There are 3 ways to register event handlers for a DOM element, but we will only learn about the the method used in modern web pages:

1. ü•á EventTarget.addEventListener(): Read in detail üìñ  [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener)
2. HTML attribute: *This method should be avoided! It inflates the markup, and makes it less readable. Concerns of content/structure and behavior are not well-separated, making a bug harder to find.*
3. DOM element properties: *The problem with this method is that only one handler can be set per element and per event.*

Still curious about the difference between the 3 methods? üìñ  [Read this examples](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Events#dom_event_handler_list)

### Event API

The Event interface represents an event which takes place in the DOM. Event handlers may be attached to DOM elements: click on a¬†button, the document, the Window...etc.

When an event occurs as we have seen before, a new¬†`event`¬†object is created through the event listeners.

Let's have a better look at this concept üìñ  [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event) and learn about the [Interfaces based on Event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event)

### Add Event Listener

`addEventListener()` sets up a function that will be called whenever the specified event is delivered to the target. Ok, let's learn about the Syntax behind this, read the üìñ  article about [EventTarget.addEventListener()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener)
