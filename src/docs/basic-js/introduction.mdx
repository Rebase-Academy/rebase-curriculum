## Introduction

Now let's learn about one of the most used languages for web development!

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), JavaScript is "*a high level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language. It has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification. Alongside HTML and CSS, it is one of the three essential technologies of World Wide Web content production; the majority of websites employ it and it is supported by all modern web browsers without plug-ins. JavaScript is prototype-based with first-class functions, making it a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates and regular expressions, but does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded*".

# Basic tools

To carry out the activities in this module we recommend to add a plugin that analyzes your code for possible errors, for example, [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).
