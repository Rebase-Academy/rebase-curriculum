Congrats to get up to here! You are doing awesome ðŸš€  By now you have gone through how the Web works, what a Front-end Developer mission is and got to know some of the technical tools that will go by your side in this journey: Ubuntu (Linux), Command Line Interface (CLI) and VS Code (as text editor).

Now it is time to ask you to prove a bit of your learnings with a short test. Do not worry if you don't know the perfect answer for every question, we just want you to **do it the best you can and encourage you to review the materials** for those questions that you find more difficulties answering. You can take it as many times as you want to.

Test change.
