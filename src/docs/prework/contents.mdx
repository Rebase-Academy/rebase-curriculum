In the Prework you won't have to do any exercises at the end of each topic, however you will find a test at the end that we need you to answer (you will find more information once you get to that part).

### How the web works

By now we should all have realized that the Internet has affected almost every aspect of our lives as a society. It is present in the businesses, in the health system, in the educational entities, in the services... But it is still a bit mysterious how it works behind the scenes for most of the people using it. Since you are willing to be part of the Doers of the Internet, let's discover a bit closer how it works :)

### Front-end developer

The purpose of this bootcamp is to help you become a Front-end developer, but, do you really know what it does mean? Take a minute to think about it.

The following resources have been selected to give you more context on what a Front-end developer does, the resources they can make use of and in summary, a bit more of what you can expect to start understanding during this bootcamp!

Please, **read from this summary the chapters 1 and 2.1**. Do not worry about the rest, because you don't need them now :)

ðŸ“–  [What Is a Front-end Developer?](https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2019/#2)

ðŸ“– [Baseline Web Technologies Employed by Front-End Developers](https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2019/#3.3)

ðŸ“– [Front-End on a Team](https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2019/#3.6)

Do not worry if you don't understand it all... What makes a developer, is learning! Read about it in the next post!

### Filesystem

These are basic introductory videos to what files and folders - also called directories - are and how we can use them. If you already have experience with them, feel free to skip this part, but we encourage you to take a look at them!

ðŸ“½  **[Basic file management system - Pt 2 - Nesting & Sorting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGd48PGbnBs)**

The look and feel of what you'll see in these videos might not be exactly the same you'll find in your computer. Don't worry, the idea is the same :)

### Ubuntu

Ubuntu is the operating system (OS) you are going to use in RefugeesCode course. It is widely used in the technical scene and very flexible. Get to know it a little more!

Again, it is not needed you understand everything that here is mentioned, but try to get familiar with its concepts and possibilities.

### Terminal

Prepare to get used to this powerful tool because it is one of the most spread among developers and as soon as you start using it you will understand why! With very few commands you will be able to do HUGE things across many operating systems, in your computer or in a remote server.

The following resources will give you a summary of what the terminal is and some commands you can get the most of!

### Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is a text editor specifically created to be used with programming languages. It is easy to integrate with other tools we will use, as git.

Take a a first look to its appearance and the potential it has:
